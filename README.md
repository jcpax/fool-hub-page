# Fool.com Front End Developer Test Project

Overview <br>This is a my Motley Fool Front End Developer interview project. It is a simple hub page for Stock Market News that diplays articles from a json data file.

I kept things pretty simple and stuck mainly to Javascript and jQuery. If you have any further questions please let me know.

Features<br>
<ul>
	SA Info
	<li>styled the join_sa.html to make a prominent CTA to attract users to this feature</li>
		<li>table is mobile optimized</li>
</ul><ul>
	Articles Display
		<li>articles display the 5 most recent and can expand with a read more button</li>
		<li>I pulled the image, title, author, date and promo for each article from the articles.json file</li>
</ul><ul>
	Searching
		<li>searching dropdowns filter on bureau and exchange</li>
</ul>

Notes:
	I tried to optimize the page for SEO with meta tags and relevant information.
