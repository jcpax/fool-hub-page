# Fool.com Front End Developer Test Project

Overview This is a my Motley Fool Front End Developer interview project. It is a simple hub page for Stock Market News that diplays articles from a json data file.

I kept things pretty simple and stuck mainly to Javascript and jQuery. If you have any further questions please let me know.

Features
	SA Info
		- styled the join_sa.html to make a prominent CTA to attract users to this feature
		- table is mobile optimized
	Articles Display
		- articles display the 5 most recent and can expand with a read more button
		- I pulled the image, title, author, date and promo for each article from the articles.json file
	Searching
		- searching dropdowns filter on bureau and exchange

Notes:
	I tried to optimize the page for SEO with meta tags and relevant information.
